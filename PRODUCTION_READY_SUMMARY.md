## 🔧 Required Actions Before Going Live

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
```bash
# Upgrade Supabase
- Go to Supabase dashboard
- Upgrade to Pro plan (£20/month)
- Enable connection pooling

# Setup Redis for queue
- Deploy Redis instance (Railway/Upstash)
- Configure REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT, REDIS_PASSWORD in .env

# Fix Backend
Option A: Fix Railway
- Reconnect to Supabase
- Deploy latest code
- Test webhooks

Option B: Deploy to Render.com
- Create new web service
- Set environment variables
- Configure auto-deploy from GitHub
```

### 2. Purchase Phone Numbers
```bash
# VAPI Dashboard
- Purchase 12 UK phone numbers
- Configure each for outbound calling
- Add to phone_numbers table in Supabase
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Add to `.env`:
```env
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=your-redis-host
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-redis-password

# VAPI
VAPI_API_KEY=da8956d4-0508-474e-bd96-7eda82d2d943
```

### 4. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Production ready - cleaned data, added campaign processor"
git push origin main

# Netlify will auto-deploy
```

## 📈 Testing Checklist

Before going live with 2000 calls/day:

- [ ] Test with 10 calls
- [ ] Verify webhook processing
- [ ] Check AI lead qualification
- [ ] Confirm phone rotation works
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Verify call windows
- [ ] Check cost tracking
- [ ] Test pause/resume functionality
- [ ] Verify retry logic
- [ ] Check monitoring dashboard

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

1. **Access Campaign Processor**
   ```
   https://your-app.netlify.app/campaign-processor
   ```

2. **Import Leads**
   - Go to Campaign Details
   - Click "Import Leads"
   - Upload CSV file

3. **Start Campaign**
   - Select "Emerald Green Energy Demo"
   - Click "Start" button
   - Monitor progress in real-time

4. **Monitor Costs**
   - View daily stats
   - Track success rate
   - Monitor spend

## 📞 Support & Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Calls per day: Target 2000
- Success rate: Target >70%
- Cost per call: £2.05
- Lead qualification rate: Target >30%

### Alert Thresholds
- If success rate < 50%: Check phone numbers
- If cost > £150/day: Review settings
- If queue stuck: Restart processor
- If no webhooks: Check backend

## 🚦 Go-Live Sequence

1. **Day 1**: Test with 100 calls
2. **Day 2**: Scale to 500 calls
3. **Day 3**: Scale to 1000 calls
4. **Day 4**: Full production - 2000 calls/day

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start calls early**: Begin at 9 AM to maximize daily capacity
2. **Monitor hourly**: Check progress every hour initially
3. **Adjust pacing**: If behind schedule, increase rate slightly
4. **Watch costs**: Daily spend should be ~£205
5. **Track conversions**: Focus on appointment bookings

## 🔐 Security Notes

- VAPI API key is hardcoded (update in production)
- OpenAI key needs to be updated
- Supabase anon key is public (this is normal)
- Add rate limiting on API endpoints
- Implement user authentication for processor
