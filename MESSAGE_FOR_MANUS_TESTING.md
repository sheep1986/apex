# Testing Request for Manus

## Quick Test Needed

Hey Manus,

Can you please test the VAPI campaigns feature? We've fixed several issues but need to verify it's working on a fresh browser.

## Test Steps:

1. **Open the app in a fresh browser** (or incognito mode): https://aquamarine-klepon-bcb066.netlify.app/
2. **Login** with your credentials
3. **Navigate to Campaigns** from the sidebar
4. **Check if you see campaigns** in the list
5. **Click on any campaign** (like "test mm" if visible)
6. **Check if the campaign details show**:
   - Leads Called count
   - Answered count
   - Campaign progress

## What We Fixed:

‚úÖ **Authentication Issue** - Fixed Clerk JWT tokens not being sent to Railway
‚úÖ **Direct Supabase Integration** - Bypassed broken Railway API, going straight to database
‚úÖ **Campaign Counts** - Added proper lead/call counting from database
‚úÖ **Display Mapping** - Fixed undefined errors in campaign details page

## Known Issues:

1. **Railway Backend** - The `/api/vapi-outbound/campaigns/{id}` endpoint doesn't exist on Railway
2. **Browser Caching** - Users with cached JS need to clear cache to see fixes
3. **Organization ID** - Currently hardcoded to Sean's org, needs dynamic detection

## Current Status:

- **Database**: ‚úÖ All data exists correctly (34 campaigns, leads, calls all linked)
- **Frontend Code**: ‚úÖ Fixed and deployed to Netlify
- **Backend API**: ‚ùå Railway missing endpoints, using Supabase directly instead
- **Sean's Browser**: ‚ùå Cached old JS, needs complete cache clear

## Test Data:
- **Campaign**: "test mm"
- **Expected Leads**: 1
- **Expected Calls**: 1
- **Status**: Active

## Important:

**Please test in a fresh browser or incognito mode** to avoid cache issues. Sean's browser is caching old JavaScript despite multiple attempts to clear it.

Let me know if you see:
1. Campaigns loading properly
2. Campaign details displaying counts
3. Any console errors

## Technical Summary:

The app now uses `DirectSupabaseService` to fetch data directly from Supabase, bypassing the broken Railway API. This ensures data loads even when the backend is down. The organization ID is hardcoded temporarily but all the data queries work correctly.

**Quick Check**: If you open the browser console, you should see logs like:
- "üîÑ Using direct Supabase service..."
- "‚úÖ VapiDashboard: Campaigns loaded from Supabase: Array(34)"

Thanks for testing! This will confirm if the issue is just Sean's browser cache or if there's still a deployment problem.
