âœ… Note Deletion Feature Complete!

The following has been implemented:

1. DELETE CONFIRMATION DIALOG:
   - A modal dialog now appears when clicking the delete (trash) icon on any note
   - The dialog asks "Are you sure you want to delete this note?"
   - Two buttons: Cancel (gray) and Delete Note (red)
   - Beautiful dark theme styling with red accent for delete action

2. DATABASE PERSISTENCE:
   - When confirmed, the note is deleted from Supabase database
   - The deletion updates the lead's custom_fields.notes array
   - Changes persist across page refreshes

3. USER EXPERIENCE:
   - Immediate UI update after deletion (no page refresh needed)
   - Toast notification shows success/error feedback
   - Cancel button dismisses dialog without changes
   - Modal has backdrop blur for focus

HOW TO TEST:
1. Navigate to any lead detail page (/lead/:id)
2. Look for the Notes section
3. Click the trash icon on any note
4. Confirm deletion in the dialog
5. Verify the note is removed

The implementation includes:
- handleDeleteNote(): Triggers confirmation dialog
- confirmDeleteNote(): Performs actual deletion
- cancelDeleteNote(): Dismisses dialog
- State management for noteToDelete and showDeleteConfirm
- Beautiful modal with Trash2 icon and red theming
